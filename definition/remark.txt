The start symbol is block.

Two non-terminals, integer and var, are specified informally by:
  – integer: An optional minus sign, followed by one or more decimal digits.
  – var: A letter, followed by zero or more letters or digits. However, reserved words are not allowed to be
         vars. The reserved words are:
         if, then, else, let, in, True, False.
  If the parser sees a reserved word when a var is expected, it is considered a parser error.

There can be spaces, tabs, and newlines (collectively known as whitespaces) around integers, vars, and terminal strings. For example
      let { x           
          = 4 * (         
     5+6) ;
  } in \ y ->    if x < y then x else y
is allowed.
